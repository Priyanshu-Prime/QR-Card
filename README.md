## My process
I started with looking at the expected design, and then tried to add all the elements together first in the HTML file. I then proceeded to work upon the styling of the page, adding all the necessary details I could see with my eyes and trying to be as close to the required result as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I would like to keep working and learning the flexbox properties as those take me the most amount of time, due to alignment issues.
